## Keyboards

*   [Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/b2m-00012)

    This is not good implementation of "rubber dome", some keys feel different from others.
    And the board design makes distance between `Ctrl` and `V` keys a way too long.
    Typing on this keyboard is far less pleasant as on other quality "rubber dome" keyboards.
    Frequent hitting `Ctrl + V` leads to faster finger fatigue.
    This particular disadvantage me be not relevant for people with long fingers.

    ANNE Pro is the main competitor for Poker keyboards. It is not awesome because of the price.
    Anne Pro is not reasonably cheaper then the Poker and does not have any real advantage over Poker.
    Bluetooth is not fast and can be irritating. Programmability is worth then on Poker.
    The "ANNE PRO 2" is match better.

*   [Logitech Illuminated Living-Room Keyboard K830](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/living-room-keyboard-k830?crid=27)

    Reviews: [The Best Wireless Keyboard](https://youtu.be/x6rzna_UGXs), [Logitech K830 illuminated Wireless keyboard with touchpad - Review!](https://youtu.be/C-65K9GcXuU)

    This keyboard is actually very good. It is awesome for "couch typing", but not for a professional use.
    The main disadvantage is flat keycaps - no groove for fingers.

*   [Filco Majestouch Minila Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.diatec.co.jp/en/det.php?prod_c=1320)

    [Обзор Filco Majestouch Minila Air — механика с Bluetooth!](https://youtu.be/e1NwGeinRj0)

    The keyboard is great, but has only one disadvantage for 60%-size &mdash; is not programmable.
    The shorter \<Space\> and two \<Fn\> keys on both sides - is a grate design decision.


## Headphones

    Like others **beyerdynamic**, this one has bright treble. Not for comfort long easy listening.

    Need a good powerful amplifier. Has bright treble. No comfortable for small head.
    Other then that - this are amazing.
