## Keyboards

*   [Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/b2m-00012)

    This is not good implementation of "rubber dome", it cause some keys feel different from others.
    And the shell design makes distance between <Ctrl> and <V> keys a way too long.
    Typing on this keyboard is far less pleasant as on mechanical.
    Frequent hitting Ctrl+V leads to faster finger fatigue.

*   [ANNE Pro](http://en.obins.net/anne-pro)

    [Anne Pro RGB Wireless Gaming Mechanical Keyboard - Unboxing & Review](https://youtu.be/mJ1fsALtGXo) \
    [Remapping Anne Key to Left Alt key?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnePro/comments/6v675e/remapping_anne_key_to_left_alt_key/)

    The main competitor for Pok3r keyboards. This is not awesome because of the price.
    Anne Pro is not reasonably cheaper the Pok3r and does not have any real advantage over Pok3r.

*   [Logitech Illuminated Living-Room Keyboard K830](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/living-room-keyboard-k830?crid=27)

    [Logitech K830 illuminated Wireless keyboard with touchpad - Review!](https://youtu.be/C-65K9GcXuU)

    This keyboard is actually very good, perhaps even awesome.
    The one disadvantage is flat keycaps, without groove for fingers.
