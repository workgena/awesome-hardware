## Keyboards

*   [Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/b2m-00012)

    This is "rubber dome" implemented in no high quality, causing some keys feel different from others.
    And the shell design make distance between <Ctrl> and <V> keys a way too long.
    Typing on this keyboard is far less pleasent as on mechanical.
    And hittng Ctrl+V leads to fast finger fatigue.

*   [ANNE Pro](http://en.obins.net/anne-pro)

    Reviews: [Poker vs. Anne Pro ~ 60% KEYBOARD BATTLE!](https://youtu.be/EbnRgkCS73w)
    As many cheap 60% keyboads the Anne Pro has this huge disadvantage:
    accessing the FN-layer keys is made by "toggle mode" instead of holding Fn-key as implemented on Poker keyboards.
