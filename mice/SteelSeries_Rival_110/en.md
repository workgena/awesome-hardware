# [SteelSeries Rival 110](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-110)

The new incarnation of Rival 100. This Rival 110 has better materials, scroll and new sensor. Noticeable  change is the sensor - lift up distance. In old 100 version it was high(about 3 mm), newer one has ~1.5 mm. Build quality is better, but still not good enough.
