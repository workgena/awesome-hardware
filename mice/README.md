# Mice

Most mice are "Gaming", but they are good for office work as well.
The good mouse is a mouse with such aspects: weight 85-100 g, height: 34-40 mm, shape: ergonomic.

If you feel pain in right shoulder/wrist - it's time to get a "Vertical Mouse".

The "Vertical" shape supports your hand in an upright neutral posture
that generally avoids forearm twisting.
Many users, including medical doctors, ergonomists and physical therapists,
recommends "Vertical" mice.

But do not go to absolutely vertical 90 degrees, it is better about 45-70 degrees.
One of the best choice is [Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse](sculpt_ergonomic_mouse/README.md).

Good explanation by Steve Meagher: [The Ergonomics Guy - How To Choose A Mouse](https://youtu.be/Ikzp22bNxOs).


*Tip: Many cheap clone-mice can be found on AliExpress - buy the cheapest clone of your choice. It if fits your hand - then buy real original quality product.*
