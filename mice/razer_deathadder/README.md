DeathAdder is simply the best successor of iconic **Microsoft IntelliMouse 3.0A**. Razer have been produced this mouse over 10 years by now. DeathAdder Elite is considered as the most advanced and ergonomic Razer's mouse. And it really is!

It is hard to find a person who don't like this mouse once tried.

Being the most popular product in the World has one drawback - every manufacturer wants to make own clone. And they did. DeathAdder has tons of competitors, some of them are really good and cheaper. But the Elite is at the top.

 then DeathAdder Elite.Notice. The **Razer Mamba** has different shape, it is heavy. But the new "Mamba HyperFlux" is different story, better shape, reasonable weight. Mamba HyperFlux even better(more comfortable) then DeathAdder Elite.

## Why is it awesome?
DeathAdder has been one of the most popular gaming mouse ever since its initial release in 2006. It is comfortable for every-day usage. The mouse has "everything right".

## What is good?
- Shape, materials, buttons, etc.. Mouse is really comfortable.
- Advanced "hardware" - sensor, buttons, feet, etc.

## What is wrong?
- Soft-touch materials are hard to clean. This mouse will not look as good as new after a year of use.
- Right side might be uncomfortable for someone(almost impossible to notice that). Zowie EC-A series is better on this point.
- Razer is "famous" of their random quality. Buttons may not live long(if you play games a lot). For office users buttons live longer.

## Important specs
- Weight: 95g
- Dimensions: 127 mm (Length) x 70 mm (Width) x 44 mm (Height)

## Recommendations
Use mouse on a soft mouse pad.
