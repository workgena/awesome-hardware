# [Leopold FC660C](http://global.leopold.co.kr/product.php?pcode=fc660c)

The keyboard with grate implementation and Topre switchers, comes in compact 60%-size, but also has dedicated arrow-keys, plus Insert and Delete buttons. If you need as match compact keyboard as possible, but can't thrown away the arrow keys - this keyboard is for you. The rating of this keyboard among 65% keyboards is **Top-1**.

Version with Cherry MX switchers is [LEOPOLD FC660M](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3546). The Topre version, as always, is far better
then Cherry, read the [comparison](https://deskthority.net/review-f45/leopold-fc660c-and-fc660m-side-by-side-comparison-t6443.html).

## Why is it awesome?
The form factor is like 60% but with dedicated arrows and Insert/Delete buttons. So it is a little longer compare to true 60% keyboards. The overall build and feel of Topre switchers are top notch. In this form-factor this keyboard has no competitors. There are a few boards in such layout, but they all are mechanical (Cherry, Gateron etc.), and the build quality/feeling is nothing compare to Leopold.

* Layout, the arrows keys
