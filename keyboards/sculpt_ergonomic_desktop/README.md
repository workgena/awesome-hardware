# [Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00001)

> Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop is built on advanced ergonomic principles, with a split keyboard layout that keeps wrists and forearms in a relaxed position, and a cushioned palm rest to provide wrist support. The domed keyboard shape works to reduce and correct wrist pronation that can cause pain and limited mobility.

If you are looking for a slitted curved keyboard with low-profile keys - this is the only good choice.

## Why is it awesome?
Possibly, the most **healthy keyboard** on the market today.
This keyboard is recommended for everyone who feels pain or hand fatigue.
Split keyset design. Good implementation and build. Despite being member and low profile, this keyboard feels pretty awesome while typing.

## What is good?
- Full-size arrow keys (Up/Down)
- Membrane low-profile keys implementation is good
- Wrist rest is made from pleasant materials
- This is a combo with mouse and separated NumPad

## What is wrong?
- The distance between Left Control and "V" (`Ctrl+V`) is a bit long and not very comfortable for small/medium fingers.
- `Esc` button(F-keys too) is made in another form-factor, it is small and click is different from regular keys. VIM users might not like this key.
- Some keys (like T, G, H, N) are longer then standard. Not really comfortable for blind typing.
- Needs quite long time to get used to. Because of cons described above, and not because split design.

## Important specs
- Wireless
- Membrane low-profile keys
- Dimensions: 392 x 228 x 58 mm
- Weight: 842 g
- Works not only with Windows. Supports Mac and Linux as well.
