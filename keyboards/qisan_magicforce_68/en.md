The biggest advantage of this keyboard, and why it is so heavily recommended, is that it comes in so many different brands of switches. Probably the most recommended budget mechanical keyboard. Compact 65% layout size with dedicated arrow keys. LED backlight. Price starts from $40.

## Why is it awesome?
The compact size and the key layout are the key points. Despite being almost 60% size it has dedicated arrow keys and Insert, Delete, PgUp and PgDown keys. With Fn-key the PgUp/PgDown becomes Home/End - which is really useful. DIP-switchers on the bottom allows to swap CapsLock <-> Ctrl.

- compact size
- standard key, can be replace them with custom keycaps
- switch choose (sorted from cheap to expensive):
  * OUTEMU
  * Kailh
  * Gateron
  * Charry MX
- floating key design is easy to clean

  * swap Win <-> Fn
  * disable Win-key (Game mode)
- Price, from $40 to $90

## What's wrong?
- definitely is not premium look
- weird font on the keycaps
- DIP-switchers not available in cheapest version
- no LED backlight in cheapest version
