# Awesome Keyboards

Keyboards grouped by size and sorted by awesomeness. The selection criteria are: comfort, features, programmability, switchers type. 100%-size keyboards are remnant of the past. If you need numpad you should by the separate "Number Pad Keyboard". But still, below you will find some full-size keyboards only because they have some really unique and awesome features. Wrist reset is good addition, better to buy separately.
