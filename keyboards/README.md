# Awesome Keyboards

Keyboards are grouped by size and sorted by awesomeness.
This list is build with such criteria in mind: **comfort**, **features**, **programmability**, **switchers** type.
100%-size keyboards are remnant of the past. They are not recommended for general use.
If you need *NumPad* you should by the separate "Number Pad Keyboard".
But still, below you will find some full-size keyboards only because they have some really unique and awesome features.

Wrist reset is good addition, better to buy separately.

The most valuable products are in 65% and 80%-size category.

60% layout keyboards may not suit you if you often use combination `Ctrl + F1`(-F12),
because with such keyboards you need hold `Fn + Ctrl + F1` at the same time.
Using arrows is not uncomfortable as it may seem.

If you already feel shoulder/wrist pain it is highly recommended go for split-keyboard-layout, like:
*Adesso keyboards*,
*Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop*,
*Matias Ergo Pro*,
*ErgoDox*,
*Ultimate Hacking Keyboard*,
*Mistel Barocco*,
*Goldtouch ErgoSecure 2.0*
