# [iKBC New Poker II](https://www.ikbckeyboard.com/product-page/new-poker-ii-black)

Probably the most known and customizable 60% size keyboard, remarkably good product with history.

> The New Poker II is a compact, aesthetically pleasing and highly functional keyboard.

**New Poker II** equipped with *Cherry MX* Switches, available in Red, Brown and Blue. Case color: Black or White ([mechanicalkeyboards.com](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=483)). This keyboard is fully programmable via hardware so no software is required.

**Notice.** If you are looking for other type of switchers, then take a look at *KBParadise V60* with ALPS/Matias/Kailh switchers, or at *Plum Nano 75* with Topre clones.

## Why is it awesome?

> The POK3R is very much THE standard when it comes to 60% keyboards. All other mechanical keyboards are measured against it, and there's good reason why. [@skiwithpete](https://youtu.be/J4_SWpOE6wM)

Beautiful, elegant keyboard. Fully programmable. Layout Layers, programmable layers. *Top-1 programmable keyboard* in 60%-size category.

## What is good?

- Build quality and overall implementation
- Fully programmable, 3 layers, no software required
- DIP switchers:
  * layouts (Qwerty, Dvorak, Colemak, Workman)
  * change Fn & Pn positions
  * turns on the arrow keys on Left Shift / Fn / Pn / Ctrl
  *  swap Capslock / Left Ctrl
   * swap Win / Alt

## What is wrong?

- Doesn't have adjustable feet

## Important specs

- Weight: 545g
- Dimensions: 290(L) x 120(W) x 28(H) mm
- No LED/backlight
- Keycap Material: PBT
- USB 2.0 and Type-C connection

## Recommendations

Some keys are not programmable(keys assigned to layouts); some(like Fn) can be remapped only in non-default layer (google how to do it). In this aspect **Vortex Pok3r** allows a bit more flexibility.

# [Vortex POK3R](http://www.vortexgear.tw/vortex2_3.asp?kind=47&kind2=220)

> Pok3r is a programmable 60% keyboard from KBT. It is the successor to the original KBC Poker II. Versions are available with single color or RGB back lighting (with doubleshot ABS keycaps) and without back lighting (with printed PBT keycaps) [@deskthority](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Vortex_Pok3r)

![img](pok3r.jpg?style=centerme)

**Notice.** *Pok3r* doesn't have [Workman Layout](http://workmanlayout.org/), but the *New Poker II* has it. Both keyboards are very similar and has almost identical functionality.

It comes in Black/White case color, and with all family of Cherry MX switchers, with white LED backlight or RGB. Check them out at [mechanicalkeyboards.com](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=165).

**Notice.** The difference between Poker II and is not critical. The noticeable difference is RGB and weight.

The default arrow mapping is different from Poker II, but of cause it is fully programmable within non-default layers, keycap material.

## Why is it awesome?

> If you're looking for an RGB keyboard that is 60% there's not much that beats this, in fact I don't think that there is really anything that compares. [@Tech Intake](https://youtu.be/ppeti2j4qBE)

## What is good?

- DIP switchers
  * layouts (Qwerty, Dvorak, Colemak)
- RGB backlight
- Programmability slightly better the on Poker II

## Important specs

- Weight: 1.3 kg
