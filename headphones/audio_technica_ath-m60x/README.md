Excellent build quality and Audio Technica’s rock-solid reputation only sweeten the deal.  But once you put these babies on and give them a listen, there’s no going back; this really is an impressive headphone that sounds nothing short of miraculous.

## Why is it awesome?
> Even if you had tons of money to spend, you still might not get a better sound with a different pair of cans. Instead, I would say, get the M60X and consider a good DAC or a high-res DAP for FLAC or WAV files. Then kick back and kiss the sky. [@Audio46](https://audio46.com/audio-technica-ath-m60x-review/)
