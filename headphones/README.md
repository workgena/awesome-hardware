The Sound and the Music is very sensitive topic for many of popple. Define the *awesome* is almost impossible. Everyone hears differently. That's why we divide and sort them by the price.

This list compiled not for professional musician. The main audience is people who just want to listen the music all day long, while working or doing something on the computer. Not for audiophiles for sure, but even they may find this list useful.

[Open/Close-back design](https://www.headphone.com/pages/open-vs-closed-headphones) is up to you. Open-back design is preferable for working in not noisy environment, Close - for open-space offices.

Therefore the criteria for awesomeness are:
1. **Comfort**. Without any inconvenience of pressure on ears.
2. **Mellowed Sound**: soft, gentle, tender. For long hours of listening.
3. **Easy to drive**. Should work fine without AMP or external DAC. And reveal full potential with it.

**WARNING:** Comfort criteria defines the [Fit Type](https://www.headphone.com/pages/headphone-fit-types) - Over Ear and On Ear are highly preferable. Many great products are not listed below case of Easy to drive criteria and mellow sound, - most headphones should work good on any laptop/PC with on-board sound card.
