The Sound and the Music is very sensitive topics for many of people. Define the *awesome* is almost impossible. Everyone hears differently. That's why we divide and sort them by the price.

This list compiled not for professional musicians/audiophiles. The main audience is people who just want to listen the music all day long, while working on the computer. This list contains very good items, even audiophiles will find it reasonable.

[Open/Close-back design](https://www.headphone.com/pages/open-vs-closed-headphones) is up to you. Open-back design is preferable for working in quiet environment, Close-back for open-space offices.

Therefore the criteria for awesomeness are:
1. **Comfort**. Any inconvenience or pressure on ears are unacceptable.
2. **Mellowed Sound**: soft, gentle, tender. For long hours of listening.
3. **Easy to drive**. Should work fine without AMP or external DAC. And reveal full potential with it.

**WARNING:** Comfort criterion defines the [Fit Type](https://www.headphone.com/pages/headphone-fit-types) - *Over Ear* and *On Ear* are highly preferable. Many great products are not listed here case of *Easy to drive* and *Mellow sound* criteria, - most headphones should work good on any laptop/PC with on-board sound card.
